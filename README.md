# AI-MINI-PROJECT--Chatbot-

Abstract:
A Chatbot is an automated computer software program that are capable to carry out intelligent live conversations with humans.
We are going to build a chatbot using Artificial Intelligence techniques. 
The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents),  patterns, and responses.
We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses
A Chatbot can give different responses from the same input given by the user according to the current conversation issue.

Problem Definition:
 Artificial intelligence chatbot is a technology that makes interactions between man and machines without any human interaction.
we aim to develop such a Chatbot to solve basic user queries.
